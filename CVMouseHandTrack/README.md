mouse control using hand gestures by Aza#ZLO

1) To run the program, you need to install the libraries with the command:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2) Next, run the file main.py by command:
    python main.py
 
After launching, we will see a window with an fps counter, when we enter the hand into the camera overview, we will see that the track of our hand is working

To control the position of the mouse, you need to use such a hand gesture (just raise your index finger):

If the gesture is correct, then a red circle will appear on the index finger

To click with the left mouse button, use this gesture. The distance between the fingers will appear in the image, when the red circle between the fingers turns yellow - the click is fixed

To right-click, use this gesture. The distance between the fingers will appear in the image, when the red circle between the fingers turns yellow - the click is fixed

To change the volume of the mixer there are 2 movements based on the same principle. The first is to zoom in and out of the hand with a gesture from the camera, the second is the use of fingers.To confirm the volume change, it is enough to lower the little finger
